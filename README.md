# Creativize - Image Generator App

An image generator that allows you to enter a prompt (or choose a random one) and an image will be generated using the OpenAI API. You can then select to make modifications, download the image, or share it to the community where it will be displayed on a page for everyone to see. Created using the MERN stack, cloudinary, and OpenAI API.
